# prism-simulator
 A program that simulates the 2D trajectory of a laser going through a prism.

Run prism.py 

Up-down arrows: Changes the shape of the prism (thetaB of the isocele triangle)
Left-right arrows: Turns the prism
W-S: Changes the y-axis of the incoming beam of light.
A-D: Changes the x-axis of the wall 

The light source is on the right side, and it hits a "wall" on the left side. The plot on the right shows how the point on the wall changes with the rotation of the prism.
